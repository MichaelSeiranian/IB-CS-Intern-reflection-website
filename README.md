Planning
Problem identification
The following information is taken from the initial interview which can be found in the appendix. Alexander Klaiss (client), the supervisor of the Microsoft internship, collects reflections from the interns weekly, after their sessions at Microsoft so that they can form an organized reflection presentation at the end of the internship. Currently, the method of weekly reflection consists of meetings where students individually talk to Mr Klaiss their reflection is noted down in a booklet. There are multiple limitations in the current method of reflection collection. The weekly meetings take up a big amount of Mr Klaiss’ time outside his working hours, as each student must individually consult with Mr Klaiss and go through the lengthy process of evaluation. Furthermore, their progress is simply written in brief words into a booklet, which is a lengthy process. There is another minor issue of students being able to see each other’s reflections by looking into the booklet, which is not supposed to happen, since each of their reflections must be individual.

Rationale for proposed solution
After discussing multiple solutions with Mr. Klaiss, we agreed on a website as a solution for his problem. I chose to code the website using HTML and PHP, with the help of MySQL to interact with the database, as MySQL works seamlessly with PHP. Ultimately, I chose to design the website using CSS, because allows me to meet the requirements of Mr. Klaiss’ desired reflection portal, working well with HTML, allowing for an intuitive GUI where he and students are able to log in and write reflections.
